Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) was a painterly French impressionist artist known for his playful, colorful landscape paintings and portraits. He was born near Paris in a poor working-class home, where his father was a mechanic and his mother was a seamstress. His interest in art awakened early and he began to study painting at the age of 14. Renoir later studied at the Beaux-Arts in Paris, which led him to become one of the most important artists of French Impressionism. During his career, he began to apply light, wavy lines and vivid colors to capture the atmosphere and feeling of his paintings. He mainly painted landscapes and portraits, but he also painted genre and still images that reflected his zest for life and joy. Renoir's paintings are known for capturing the innermost beauty of nature and his work has inspired many other artists. His greatest work is La Balançoire (1876), which shows a playful and lively image of three children playing on a swing. His work has been featured in many exhibitions and has remained popular for over a century. Renoir's paintings are a monument to the happy, lively and colorful life that he tried to capture with his art.",https://gallerix.ie/poster/5108-roses-in-a-vase-by-auguste-renoir,https://img.gallerix.com/product/google/5108.jpg,14.90 EUR,11.92 EUR,in stock,new,Gallerix,5108,"Home & Garden > Decor > Artwork > Posters, Prints, & Visual Artwork",Poster special,Beige/Green/Red,Famous artists,IE
